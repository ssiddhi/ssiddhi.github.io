<!-- Final Project Web Development Winter 2023 -->

Welcome to my personal portfolio website for CS563 - Intro to Web Development. To view this project, go to https://ssiddhi.github.io/
This is a professional personal website that highlights our professional experience.
We need to feature a Navbar, an About section, a Previous work section, a Projects section and a Contact section.
We need to also integrate Javascript into our project.
Website can consist of single page or multipages.
For this Project, I have used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript.
For the contact form, alert pops up on the webpage for input validation.
The repository also consists of a journal that goes through how this website is built.
